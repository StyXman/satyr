«I need a media player that thinks about music the way I think about it.
This is such a program.»

satyr is a rather minimalistic audio player based in KDE technologies, and
developed in the Python language.

it has very few, if maybe big, dependencies:

package[1]		version[2]
-------------------------------
python-kde4		4.3.1
python-tagpy		0.94.7
pyqt4-dev-tools[3]	4.5.4[4][5]

[1] the names are the ones used in debian.
[2] these are the versions used while developing
[3] or the package that provides the pyuic4 tool.
[4] I think any 4.5.x is enough.
[5] I'm currently not implementing any compatibility with 4.6

once unpacked, run 'python setup.py --help', follow instructions, and then
'satyr_main <path to collection>'. more advanced installation instructions will
come later. remember this is version 0.1beta1.

or contact me via irc: I'm StyXman on the freenode network. good luck and
happy song listening!
