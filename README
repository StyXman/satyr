«I need a media player that thinks about music the way I think about it.
This is such a program.»

satyr is a rather minimalistic audio player based in KDE technologies, and
developed in the python language.

it has very few, if maybe big, dependencies: python-kde4,
python-kaa-metadata and pyqt4-dev-tools. once installed, run 'make' and then
'python satyr.py <path to collection>'. more advanced installation
instructions will come later. remember this is version 0.1alpha.

if you have any question or suggestion and you want to conatct me, you can
send me an e-mail to:

Marcos Dione <mdione@grulic.org.ar>

or contact me via irc: I'm StyXman on the freenode network. good luck and
happy hearing!
