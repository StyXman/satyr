«I need a media player that thinks about music the way I think about it.
This is such a program.»

satyr is a rather minimalistic audio player based in KDE technologies, and
developed in the Python language.

it has very few, if maybe big, dependencies:

package[1]		version[2]
-------------------------------
python-qt4-phonon	4.6-1[5]
python-kde4		4.3.1
python-tagpy		0.94.7
pyqt4-dev-tools[3]	4.5.4[4][5]

[1] the names are the ones used in debian.
[2] these are the versions used while developing
[3] or the package that provides the pyuic4 tool.
[4] I think any 4.5.x is enough.
[5] python-qt4-phonon was added after my system changed to python-qt4_4.6-1.
    if it's not working with 4.5.x, let me know.

once unpacked, run 'python setup.py --help', follow instructions, and then
'satyr_main <path to collection>'. more advanced installation instructions will
come later.

if you have any question or suggestion and you want to contact me, you can
send me an e-mail to:

or contact me via irc: I'm StyXman on the freenode network. good luck and
happy song listening!

Shooting troubles in the head (a.k.a FAQ):
=========================================

Q: I get no songs after scanning my collection! What (doesn't) give?
A: It happened to me once. phonon didn't had any backend so no mymetypes were
   supported. Check if the output has a line like:

No mimetypes! do you have any Phonon backend installed, configured and/or working?

   If so, then please check that phonon is properly installed, configured, and has 
   at least one backend.
