satyr pretends to have the following features (some are not implemented yet):

 * The PlayList and the Collection(s) are the same thing.
 * Yours is a Collection of Albums, nothing else.
 * Some Albums are from the same artists and some are compilations.
 * If you want an ephemeral playlist you could queue songs.
 * If you want non-ephemeral playlists, then this player is not for you.
 * Ability to search Ã  la xmms, but in the same interface.
 * Tag reading and writing.
 * Order you collection based on the tags.
 * The collection discovers new files and adds them to the playlist on the fly.
 * Be able to use all the program only with your keyboard (die, mouse, die!).
